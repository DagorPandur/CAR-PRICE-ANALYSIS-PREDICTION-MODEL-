A DATA ANALYSIS AND MACHINE LEARNING (LINEAR REGRESSSION) PROJECT GEELY AUTOMOBILE 


**PROBLEM STATEMEN**T


A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the Nigerian market by setting up its manufacturing unit and producing cars locally to compete with their Nigerian, US and European counterparts.
They have contacted y me, a Data Scientist to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Nigerian market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. 
The company wants to know:

●	Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car

●	How well do those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, i have gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the Nigerian market.

**BUSINESS GOAL (OBJECTIVES)**
The goal of this work is to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. The management will use it to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

**DATA DESCRIPTION**
The dataset describes 205 rows of up-to-date information on the different features of different car models and  the price are which they are pad for in Nigeria as provided. The dataset was collected to gain a better understanding of the status of the automobile sector sector and provide an instrument that will enable Geely automobile thrive well in the sector.

**KEY INSIGHTS, OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMEDANTIONS** 

(HP= Highest price)

From the analysis carried out, the variables that are very significant in determining the price of cars include the fuel type (gas HP), car body(sedan HP),engine location(front HP), engine size(100 HP), horsepower(horsepower HP), aspiration(std, HP) and  drive wheel (fwd HP).

NOTABLE OBSERVATIONS FROM THE RESEARCH
1. The most purchase cars are those of Toyota corona and Toyota corolla series (sorted 6 times more), followed by the Toyota mark ii (3 times more than others.
2. Cars with the highest price are mostly cars from the volvo company.
3. The fuel type gas is by far preferred than the diesel type likewise the standard cars to diesel cars.
4. There is no significant difference between the two and four door cars as to preference.
5. Cars with sedan body type and those with fore wheel drive are mostly preferred.
6. Preference to engine size is those with ones between 100 and 150 and to horsepower, those between 50 to 150 as observed.
7. The more the price of the cars the lower the number of purchase with the highest purchase at price 5000 and price range 5000 to 20000. Cars out of this range are generally less purchase though at price 35000 slightly more sales is observed.
8. Cars with sedan bodies are consistently preferred even with increase in price.
9. There is increase in price with the increase in horsepower.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1. Cars with sedan car body, gas fuel type, engine size between 100 and 150, horse power of 50 to 150 with prices ranging from 5000 to 2000 are highly recommended for the best sales in Nigeria.
2. The company should consider producing cars with hardtop body type with more catchy features such as ones captured in 1 above as this car type is price highest when car body type is in consideration.
3. A new model of car  with engine in the front (away from the conventional) with the features as in 1 and 2 above should be produce, this will  have the company positioned at an edge that almost no one has explore and still leaving the company with high sales of such a car and gross profit profit at the end.
